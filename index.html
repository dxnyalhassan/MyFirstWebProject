        Two popular and highly regarded contenders are the <b>Teenie Beanie Babies</b> and the
        <b>McDonald's Changeables</b>. The 1997 Teenie Beanie Babies promotion was one of the
        most successful in history, creating a collecting craze that drew massive crowds and
        even caused shortages. The McDonald's Changeables, which were transforming toys based
        on McDonald's food items, are also often cited by fans as a standout for their creativity
        and collectible appeal.
